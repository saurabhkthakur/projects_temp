    Fix random seeds for reproducibility.
    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : int
        Random seed to be set.
    set_system : bool
        Whether to set `np.random.seed(seed)` and `random.seed(seed)`
    set_tensorflow : bool
        Whether to set `tf.random.set_random_seed(seed)`
    set_torch : bool
        Whether to set `torch.manual_seed(seed)`
    set_torch_cudnn: bool
        Flag for whether to enable cudnn deterministic mode.
        Note that deterministic mode can have a performance impact,
        depending on your model.

    Notes
    -----
    The function checks that PyTorch and TensorFlow are installed
    where the user asks to set seeds for them. If they are not
    installed, the seed-setting instruction is ignored. The intention
    is to make it easier to use this function in environments that lack
    one or both of these libraries.
    Even though the random seeds are explicitly set,
    the behavior may still not be deterministic (especially when a
    GPU is enabled), due to:
    * CUDA: There are some PyTorch functions that use CUDA functions
    that can be a source of non-determinism:
    https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html
    * PYTHONHASHSEED: On Python 3.3 and greater, hash randomization is
    turned on by default. This seed could be fixed before calling the
    python interpreter (PYTHONHASHSEED=0 python test.py). However, it
    seems impossible to set it inside the python program:
